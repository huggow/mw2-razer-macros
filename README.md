Making my personal macros for COD MW II public, hope you enjoy then =)

## List of macros:

- Snaking (must have)
- No Recoil (experimental, works best on warzone 2.0)
- Instant dropshot (break controller AA)
- Insta dropshot + JumpHop combo (Advanced movement getting discovered now)

```diff
## Installation

-Assuming you already have synapse 3 installed, follow this path:

-Macro > Arrow Down Button > Open desired macro arquive.

-Create a new game profile (optional but recommended) > Assign a key to your macro.
```

Enjoy =)
